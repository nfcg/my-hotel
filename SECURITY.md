# Security Policy
I take security issues very seriously, and will always attempt to address any vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.



## Reporting a Vulnerability
Security vulnerabilities should be sent to nuno@nunofcguerreiro.com. 
You can expect a reply in a few days, and i will have fixes out as soon as possible.

This obviously varies based on the severity of the security issue and the difficulty in remediation.

Or you can file an issue with details and create a pull request with proposed changes.
